When to use RDDs?

Consider these scenarios or common use cases for using RDDs when:

you want low-level transformation and actions and control on your dataset;
your data is unstructured, such as media streams or streams of text;
you want to manipulate your data with functional programming constructs than domain specific expressions;
you don’t care about imposing a schema, such as columnar format, while processing or accessing data attributes by name or column;
and you can forgo some optimization and performance benefits available with DataFrames and Datasets for structured and semi-structured data.


for (k,v) in rdd5_groupbykey.collect():
    print(k,[list(v)])


print(list((j[0], list(j[1])) for j in rdd5_groupbykey.collect()))
