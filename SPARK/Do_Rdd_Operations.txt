Q1: Convert all words in a rdd to lowercase and split the lines of a document using space.

Q2: Next, I want to remove the words, which are not necessary to analyze this text. 
We call these words as “stop words”; Stop words do not add much value in a text.
For example, “is”, “am”, “are” and “the” are few examples of stop words.

Transformation: groupBy
Q3: After getting the results into rdd3, we want to group the words in rdd3 based on which letters 
they start with. For example, suppose I want to group each word of rdd3 based on first 3 characters.

Transformation: groupByKey / reduceByKey 
Q4: What if we want to calculate how many times each word is coming in corpus ?

Transformation: mapPartitions
Q5: How do I perform a task (say count the words ‘spark’ and ‘apache’ in rdd3) separatly on each
partition and get the output of the task performed in these partition ?

Math / Statistical Transformation
Transformation: sample
Q6: What if I want to work with samples instead of full data ?


Transformation: union
Q 7: What if I want to create a RDD which contains all the elements (a.k.a. union) of two RDDs ?


Transformation: join
Q 8: If we want to join the two pair RDDs based on their key.


Transformation: distinct
Q 9: How to calculate distinct elements in a RDD ?


Data Structure / I/O Transformation
Transformation: coalesce
Q 10: What if I want to reduce the number of partition of a RDD and get the result in a new RDD?
