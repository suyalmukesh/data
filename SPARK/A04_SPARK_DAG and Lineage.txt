What is the difference between DAG and Lineage? Please explain with example

Lineage graph
As we know, that whenever a series of transformations are performed on an RDD, they are not evaluated immediately,
but lazily(Lazy Evaluation). When a new RDD has been created from an existing RDD, that new RDD contains a pointer
to the parent RDD. Similarly, all the dependencies between the RDDs will be logged in a graph, rather than the actual data. 
This graph is called the lineage graph.

Now coming to DAG,

Directed Acyclic Graph(DAG)
DAG in Apache Spark is a combination of Vertices as well as Edges. In DAG vertices represent the RDDs and
 the edges represent the Operation to be applied on RDD. Every edge in DAG is directed from earlier to later
 in a sequence.When we call an Action, the created DAG is submitted to DAG Scheduler which further splits the graph
 into the stages of the task.
