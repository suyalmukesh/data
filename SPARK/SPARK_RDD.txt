RDD - A GOOD NOTE ON IT
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RDD’s are collection of data items that are split into partitions and can be stored in-memory
 on workers nodes of the spark cluster. In terms of datasets, apache spark supports two types of RDD’s –
 Hadoop Datasets which are created from the files stored on HDFS and parallelized collections 
 which are based on existing Scala collections. 
 Spark RDD’s support two different types of operations – Transformations and Actions.  

DAG - Direct - Transformation is an action which transitions data partition state from A to B.
               Acyclic -Transformation cannot return to the older partition
               DAG is a sequence of computations performed on data where each node is an 
               RDD partition and edge is a transformation on top of data.   
               The DAG abstraction helps eliminate the Hadoop MapReduce multistage execution model 
               and provides performance enhancements over Hadoop.
