SQOOP - IMPORT WITHOUT PRIMARY KEY

--------------------------------------------------------------------

The Sqoop job fails and the error looks like this" Error during import: No primary key could be found for the table .
Please specify one with --split-by or perform a sequential import with '-m 1' "

Description: Usually, when you perform a Sqoop job internally it searches for the primary key in the table. If there is
no primary key the Sqoop job fails and the error looks like this" Error during import: No primary key 
could be found for the table . Please specify one with --split-by or perform a sequential import with '-m 1' ". 
The suggestion describes there are two alternative approaches to this scenario.

Best way is option 2

To specify the number of mappers as 1 (default it takes 4). So by specifying the number of mappers to 1, 
the task will be sequential and identical to a single threaded task. This will succeed only when you are 
targeting a small table if in case if you are looking for a large import this will fail as the task tends 
to run forever.

The best approach is to use split-by where you can specify the number of mappers on the bases of indexed columns
or splitting column manually( with queries
