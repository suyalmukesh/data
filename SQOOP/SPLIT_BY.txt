All,

 I am working on importing 1.2 billion rows from one of the db2 table, There is composite primary index in the table 
with at least 5 columns, hence I need to manually specify the --split-by column 
( since SQOOP does not support multi-part split-by column), I tried to run the Sqoop import with 
one of the columns from the index which is numeric , and import ran for almost 8 hrs.

I am being suggested to try with different choice for split by key, but now I have question how to choose 
column for split by 

1) is it supposed to be numeric?  or varchar is fine too?

2) can it have nulls

3)  I suppose distribution of values for the column should be as even as possible, but will it matter 
how many maps I am choosing (--num-map ## )?

or any other criteria to pay attention to?

To answer to your first two questions, don't go by some random columns instead get primary key (obviously not null). 
so that the data will be distributed evenly

 

For the 3rd question, yes you can use either --num-map or -m to increase your mapper but don't give some 
random numbers instead understand how many mappers begin used currently and increase few more extra because 
if you use very high numbers it may distrub the source DB

 

Also you can consider other properties like --as-parquetfile (or) --as-avrodatafile ,etc this will help you to compress the data and it 'may' increase the performance
